#
# for P00400 course at Oxford Brookes University
#
# this progam takes a directory containing a list of audio files as input and
# processes these files with the following algorithm:
#
# for each of the files in the directory:
# - get the artist information
# - create directories for this file using the following scheme :
#   /input_directory/artist/album/
# - put the file in the newly created directory, rename it as 
#   <tracknumber> - <artist>.<extension>
# - build a key/value table that is used to "cache" the directory in which the
#   file must go if a previous file with same artist/album info was already
#   processed
#
# the program supports mp3, ogg, flac, mp4, m4a, ape and wma file formats
# it doesn't check for filesystem errors due to special characters
# in the metadata of the files
#
# prerequisites:
# - this program has NOT been tested on windows but it should work provided
#   there are no special characters in the file's metadata, I recommend using
#   it on an OS using a filesystem with more tolerance to special characters
# - this program requires the ruby-audioinfo gem to be installed on the system
#   - install rubygems along ruby (tested with ruby 1.9.1) on your system
#   - sudo gem install ruby-audioinfo will install the library and its
#     dependencies
