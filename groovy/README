This project holds a class that overloads the << and >> operators in groovy so
they behave like the stream operators << and >> in C++, but for JSONObject and
Java Properties objects. Properties are the preferred way to store application
properties. They can be serialized to key/value files or XML files.

Using properties << json, the user can transform a json stream into a 
Properties object, and using properties >> json, the other way around.

Import the project into eclipse and run JsonStreamCategoryTests class as a 
JUnit test case.

The JSONObject class is a class from the official JSON library for Java, which 
is included in the project as a library under the org.json package.
